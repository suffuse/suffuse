### Seek Utility From FUSE?
### Something Unholy Flavors FUSE?
### Scala Users For FUSE?

--

## Suffuse is...
- virtual filesystems as collections
- lazy, composable, observable, typed
- easy to create, compose, decompose, transform
- FUSE simplified
- /proc generalized
- plan9 lobotomized

--

## Suffuse is not...
- a new system - it is "just a library"
- an end in itself, but enables countless others
- usable today - little code is published
- especially difficult to realize

--

## Suffuse, because...
- files are the universal API
- with virtual files we can influence EVERYTHING
- ...without modifying ANYTHING
- Dozens of use cases to elaborate
- such power to have left untapped

--

## Filesystems but not systems
- Filesystems as presently seen are a mess
- Unix API: direct translation of implementation detail
- FUSE API: direct translation of Unix API
- Java API: direct translation of Unix API
- an unsynchronized, mutable, Tree[Any]
- metadata is untyped, overloaded, or both
- fifty years of cruft and bad interactions
