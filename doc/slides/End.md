## Suffuse TL;DR

- we're nuts to go another day without it
- huge network effect to be had sfs*sfs*sfs
- implementation not hard (if we are glib)
- ...nobody will tolerate a flaky filesystem
- ...suffused must be rock-solid
- ...cross-platform full of fiddly details
- ..."it works" has no value
- "How did I ever live without it" does
